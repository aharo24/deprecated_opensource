Thank you for providing the additional context about your research and its accolades. Here are refined bullet points for your resume section, integrating the details of your project and the results you achieved:

1. Reversed Engineered and optimized a forked `JTerminal`, a Java-based terminal emulation system, using the 
LittleDarwin framework for mutation testing, improving test suite effectiveness by evaluating diverse 
mutation operators.
   
2. Reseached mutation testing efficacy, which established that larger test suites 
enhanced the detection of mutations, with specific operators like STRONGER and ALL proving most effective.

3. Utilized advanced scripting in shell and Python to automate data collection and test execution processes, 
significantly minimizing human error and enhancing reproducibility in a controlled environment.

4. Contributed to the field of software testing by demonstrating the critical impact of test suite size and 
mutation operator selection on the quality and comprehensiveness of software test suites.

5. Achieved 2nd place in the prestigious Great Minds in STEM (GMiS) conference for innovative research in 
mutation testing, highlighting the project's impact and my role as a key researcher.

6. Published findings that are pivotal for future mutation testing methodologies, suggesting enhancements 
that could lead to more resilient software development practices.
