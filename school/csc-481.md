vehicle for delivering --> [os]

aka waterfall process model
`CPMCD`
Communication 
planning
marketing
construction 
dev.

- it dont really work now tho. Since features change rapidly or what if customer dont know what he/she wants.

Agile SWE 
	philosophy 

	rules

	customer satisfaction 

1. individual vs process and tools 
2. working sofrware vs comprehensive documentation 
3. customer collab vs contract negotiation
4. responding change



### what is agility
- Effective (rapid and adaptive) response to change.
- Effective communication among all stakeholders.
- Drawing the customer onto the team.
- Organizing a team so that it is in control of the work performed.
- Rapid, incremental delivery of software.


#### agile process
- Driven by customer descriptions of what is required (scenarios).
- Customer feedback is frequent and acted on.
- Recognizes that plans are short-lived.
- Develops software iteratively with a heavy emphasis on construction activities.
- Delivers multiple ‘software increments’ as executable prototypes.
- Adapts as project or technical changes occur.


#### agile principles
- Customer satisfaction is achieved by providing value through software that is delivered to the customer as rapidly as possible.
- Develop recognize that requirements will change and welcome changes.
- Deliver software increments frequently (weeks not months) to stakeholders to ensure feedback on their deliveries is meaningful.
- Agile team populated by motivated individuals using face-to-face communication to convey information.
- Team process encourages technical excellence, good design, simplicity, and avoids unnecessary work.
- **face to face** best method according  to our prof
- Working software that meets customer needs is the primary goal.
- Pace and direction of the team’s work must be “sustainable,” enabling them to work effectively for long periods of time.
- An agile team is a “self-organizing team”—one that can be trusted develop well-structured architectures that lead to solid designs and customer satisfaction.
- Part of the team culture is to consider its work introspectively with the intent of improving how to become more effective its primary goal (customer satisfaction).

### Scrum framework
**this framework is agile**

product backlog:
	important

spring planning:
	order of importance 

spring backlog:
	do one of the task 


### Activity 
scrum --> requirements, analysis, design, evolution, delivery

- [ ] time-boxed
snord 


scrum team
- [ ] product owner 
whoever is pulling in that big $ 

- [ ] scrum master
who handles the decisions before production. Making sure everything checks out

- [ ] dev team
soft eng working on the tool//app

product + backlog

sprint + backlog

### daily meeting:
	what did you do?
	any obsticles?
	what do you plan? 
	

### sprint review meeting:
	4 hours
	4 weeks
	show the big demo

who is involved?
	scrum master
	dev team
	product owner 
	selected stake holder
	




#### questions
waterfall does not do what agile ? 
architectural or design
pattern



### Extreme Programming (XP) Framework
![](z/aharo24%202023-01-30%20at%206.16.46%20PM.png)

XP Planning:
– Begins with user stories, team estimates cost, stories grouped into increments, commitment made on delivery date, computer project velocity.

XP Design:
– Follows KIS principle, encourages use of CRC cards, design prototypes, and refactoring.

XP Coding:
– construct unit tests before coding, uses pair.

XP Testing:
– unit tests executed daily, acceptance tests define by customer.


### Kanban Framework
- prof. said just to youtube 
	- dev by Toyota
•Visualizing workflow using a Kanban board.
•Limiting the amount of work in progress at any given time.
•Managing workflow to reduce waste by understanding the current value flow.
•Making process policies explicit and the criteria used to define “done”.
•Focusing on continuous improvement by creating feedback loops where changes are introduced.
•Make process changes collaboratively and involve all stakeholders as needed.


devops framework
![](z/aharo24%202023-01-30%20at%206.29.18%20PM.png)


•Continuous development. Software delivered in multiple sprints.
•Continuous testing. Automated testing tools used prior to integration.
•Continuous integration. Code pieces with new functionality added to existing code running code.
•Continuous deployment. Integrated code is deployed to the production environment.
•Continuous monitoring. Team operations staff members proactively monitor software performance in the production environment.

**team dev**:
	read the safe home?
	user: farmer
	


linear model:
	ie... waterfall
	risky: dont get feedback until the end 


Spiral model:
	- good risk managment
	- project end is not always obvious
	- not suitable for small, low-risk projects.
	- good for big projects to control the risk

agile model:
	Encourage active stakeholder participation
	user stories:
		reduce barriers to participitation
	prioritize list:
		implement the most important user stories first

architectural design for agile:
1.Focus on key quality attributes and incorporate them into prototypes as they are constructed.

2.Keep in mind that successful software products combine customer-visible features and the infrastructure needed to enable them.

3.Agile architectures enable code maintainability and evolvability if attention is paid to architectural decisions and quality issues.

4.Managing and synchronizing dependencies among functional and architectural requirements is needed to ensure evolving architecture will be ready for future increments.


### estimator for agile spiral model:
1.Team should use historic data to develop an estimate of number of days needed to complete each of user stories known at the start of the project.

2.Loosely organize the user stories into sets that will make up each sprint planned to complete a prototype.

3.Sum the number of days to complete each sprint to provide an estimate for the duration of the total project.

4.Revise the estimate as requirements are added to the project or prototypes are delivered and accepted by the stakeholders.



### First prototype guidelines 
1.Transition from paper prototype to software design.
2.Prototype a user interface.
3.Create a virtual prototype.
4.Add input and output to your prototype.
5.Engineer your algorithms.
6.Test your prototype.
7.Prototype with deployment in mind.


### prototype evalutation
1.Provide scaffolding when asking for prototype feedback.
2.Test your prototype on the right people.
3.Ask the right questions.
4.Be neutral when presenting alternatives to users.
5.Adapt while testing.
6.Allow the user to contribute ideas.


### Software Release Maintenance
•Maintenance - activities needed to keep software operational after it has been accepted and released in the end-user environment.

•Corrective maintenance - reactive modification of software to repair problems discovered after the software has been delivered.

•Adaptive maintenance - reactive modification of software after delivery to keep the software usable in a changing environment.

•Perfective maintenance -  proactive modification of the software after delivery to provide new user features, better program code structure, or improved documentation.

•Preventive maintenance – proactive modification software after delivery to correct product faults before discovery by users.

•In agile process models much (but not all) of the maintenance work is preventive or perfective as new features are added.




###  quick takeaway for ch.4 
big project:
spiral

smal project:
agile 
light document
light code

adding to prototype but not production:
adaptive something
construct model
