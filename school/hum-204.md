## Rebirth: THE AGE OF THE RENAISSANCE

The Renaissance—meaning “rebirth”—was the turning point between medieval and modern times. It marks the revival of Greco-Roman culture, a movement that spread from its birthplace in Flor-ence, Italy, to all parts of the European West. More generally, it describes the broader intellectual renewal that produced a wealth of new technology and ideas, from the printing press to the for-mulation of linear perspective and other techniques for achieving pictorial naturalism, and from mapmaking to ingenious systems of record-keeping. The Age of the Renaissance, the period from roughly 1300 to 1600, witnessed a spirit of self-conscious individualism in political and economic life, as well as in the arts. Money, fame, and power were the motivating forces of the men and women who, like their modern-day counterparts, easily reconciled their worldly pursuits with their religious beliefs. The Age of the Renaissance opened with a century of European warfare and devastating plague. Nevertheless, the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw the growth of the European nation-states, the rise of a prosperous middle class, and the advancement of Classically based education, as well as the celebrated revival of Greco-Roman principles in art and architecture. An optimistic view of the human potential for knowledge and pleasure inspired this European rebirth that left the world many of its most glorious landmarks.

**A First Look:** 
	The mysterious smile of the woman in this sixteenth-century portrait (Figure 7.1) by Leonardo da Vinci (1453–1519) has intrigued viewers for centuries. Identified by modern schol-ars as the wife of the wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Gioconda and called “La Gioconda,” she is better known as Mona Lisa (see page 202). The most famous female image in the history of Western art, she has been idealized in love songs, implicated in modern mystery capers, and subjected to thousands of commercial abuses. She was even given a mustache by the twentieth-century Dada artist Marcel Du-champ (see Figure 14.27). For centuries, admirers have tried to interpret the meaning of Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile. But she is a landmark figure for other reasons, as well: She was among the first to be portrayed in a landscape setting, rather than in the traditional domestic interior. Her lifelike pres-ence is achieved by means of the techniques of aerial per-spective and sfumato, the subtle blurring of contours for which Leonardo, who is said to have worked on the portrait for three years, was famous. The prime example of the rebirth of naturalistic portraiture in the West, the Mona Lisa has be-come symbolic of the individualism and humanism that marked the Age of the Renaissance.

## TRANSITION: MEDIEVAL TO RENAISSANCE

The fourteenth century was a period of transition marked by a number of dramatic developments: the struggle for survival against the devastating bubonic plague, the trials of a long and debilitating war between England and France, and the decline of the Roman Catholic Church. These phenomena—the Black Death, the Hundred Years War, and the Great Schism—radically altered all aspects of Western European life and culture. In the arts of this era, there are clear signs of a revived self-consciousness, a growing preoccupation with gender and class, and spirited efforts to represent the world with greater objectivity. 

### The Black Death
The most devastating natural catastrophe of the fourteenth cen-tury, the bubonic plague, struck Europe in 1347. In less than a century it destroyed one-third to one-half of its population. Origi-nating in China and spread by the Mongol tribes that dominated that vast area, the disease devastated East Asia and the Middle East, interrupting long-distance trade and cross-cultural encoun-ters that had flourished for two centuries. The plague was carried into Europe by flea-bearing black rats infesting the commercial vessels that brought goods to Mediterranean ports. In its early stages, it was transmitted by the bite of either the infected flea or the host rat; in its more severe pneumonic stage, it was passed on by those infected with the disease. The symptoms of the malady were terrifying: Buboes (or abscesses) that began in the lymph glands of the groin or armpits of the afflicted slowly filled with pus, turning the body a deathly black, hence the popular label “the Black Death.” Once the boils and accompanying fever ap-peared, death usually followed within two to three days. Tradi-tional treatments, such as the bleeding of victims and fumigation with vapors of vinegar, proved useless. No connection was per-ceived between the rats and the plague itself, and in the absence of a clinical understanding of bacterial infection, the medical pro-fession of the day was helpless. (Indeed, the bacillus of the bu-bonic plague was not isolated until 1894.) The plague hit hardest in the towns, where the concentration of population and the lack of sanitation made the disease more difficult to contain. Four waves of bubonic plague spread throughout Europe between 1347 and 1375, infecting some Euro-pean cities several times and nearly wiping out their entire popu-lations (Figure 7.2). If the psychological impact of the Black Death was traumatic, its economic eff ects were equally devastat-ing. Widespread death among the poor caused a shortage of labor, which in turn created a greater demand for workers. The bargaining power of those who survived the plague was thus improved. In many parts of Europe, workers pressed to raise

# pg.179
their status and income. Peasants took advantage of opportuni-ties to become tenant farmers on lands leased by lords in need of laborers. Others fled their rural manors for cities, where jobs were readily available. This exodus from the countryside spurred urban growth and contributed to the slow disintegration of ma-norialism, the economic system that bound medieval serfs to the land (see page 135). All of Europe, however, was disadvantaged by climatic disas-ters that caused frequent crop failure and famine, and by the continuing demands of financially threatened feudal overlords. Violent working-class revolts—the first examples of labor rebel-lion in Western history—broke out in France and England in the mid-fourteenth century. In 1358, French peasants (known as jacques) staged an angry protest (the Jacquerie) that took the lives of hundreds of noblemen before it was suppressed by the French king. In England, the desperation of the poor was mani-fested in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, led by Wat Tyler and de-scribed in the Chronicles of the French historian Jean Froissart (1338–1410). Despite their ultimate failure, these revolts left their imprint on the social history of the West. They frightened landowners everywhere and lent an instability to class relation-ships that hastened the demise of the old feudal order.

### The Rise of Constitutional Monarchy 
While the peasant rebellions achieved no immediate reforms, the lower classes had taken a major step toward equality with the rest of society. England’s laborers were not the first, however, to have contested the absolute authority of the English monarch. As early as 1215, the barons of the realm had forced King John of England (1167–1216) to sign the landmark document called Magna Carta (Latin, “great charter”), which forbade the king to levy additional feudal taxes without the consent of his royal coun-cil. Magna Carta, which was also interpreted as guaranteeing such other freedoms as trial by jury, is regarded as a landmark because it asserted the primacy of law over the will of the ruler—a principle that paved the way for the development of constitu-tional monarchy. Only fifty years after the signing of Magna Carta, the English
nobility, demanding equal authority in ruling England, impris-oned King Henry III (1207–1272) and invited middle-class rep-resentatives to participate in the actions of the Great Council (Parliament), thus initiating the first example of representative government among the burgeoning nation-states of the West. During the fourteenth century, as Parliament met frequently to raise taxes for England’s wars with France, it bargained for greater power, including the right to initiate legislation. Peasants and laborers still exercised no real political influence, but by the end of the century the English had laid the groundwork for a constitutional monarchy that would bridge the gap between medieval feudalism and modern democracy.

### The Hundred Years War 
In France, the ills of plague, famine, and civil disturbance were compounded by a war with England that lasted more than one
hundred years (1337–1453) and was fought entirely on French soil. Larger and more protracted than any previous medieval conflict, the Hundred Years War was the result of a longstand-ing English claim to continental lands: From the time of the Norman Conquest, the kings of England had held land in France, a situation that caused chronic resentment among the French. But the immediate cause of the war was the English claim to the French throne, occasioned by the death of Charles IV (1294–1328), the last of the male heirs in a long line of French kings that had begun with Hugh Capet in 987 C.E. The war that began in 1337 was marked by intermittent bat-tles, in many of which the French outnumbered the English by three or four to one. Nevertheless, the English won most of the early battles of the war, owing to their use of three new “secret” weapons: the foot soldier, the longbow, and gunpowder—the invisible enemy that would ultimately eliminate the personal element in military combat. Along with the traditional cavalry, the English army depended heavily on foot soldiers armed with longbows. The thin, steel-tipped arrows of the 6-foot longbow could be fired more quickly and at a longer range than those of the traditional crossbow. Because the thin arrows of the longbow easily pierced the finest French chain mail, plate mail soon came to replace chain mail. However, within the next few centuries, even plate mail became obsolete, since it proved useless against artillery that employed gunpowder. Introduced into Europe by the Muslims, who acquired it from the Chinese, gunpowder was first used in Western combat during the Hundred Years War. In the first battle of the war, however, the incendiary substance proved too potent for the poorly cast English cannons, which issued little more than terrifying noise. Still, gunpowder, which could lay waste an entire city, constituted a landmark advance in military technology. Although the English repeatedly devastated the French armies throughout the Hundred Years War, the financial and physical burdens of garrisoning French lands ultimately proved too great for the English. Facing a revitalized French army under the charismatic leadership of Joan of Arc, the English finally withdrew from France in 1450. Of peasant background, the seventeen-year-old Joan begged the French king to allow her to obey the voices of the Christian saints who had directed her to expel the English. Donning armor and riding a white horse, she led the French into battle (Figure 7.3). Her success forced the English to withdraw from Orléans but initiated her martyrdom. Betrayed by her supporters, in 1431 she was condemned as a heretic and burned at the stake. The Hundred Years War dealt a major blow to feudalism. By the mid-fifteenth century, the French nobility was badly depleted. Hand-to-hand combat and the “rules” of medieval chivalry were outmoded by the dramatically impersonal technology of gun-powder. In France, feudal allegiances were soon replaced by a system of national conscription. In the decades following England’s withdrawal from France, both countries began to move in separate directions, ultimately becoming independent nation states.

### The Decline of the Church 
The growth of the European nation-states contributed to the weakening of the Christian commonwealth, especially where Church and state com-peted for influence and au-thority. The two events that proved most damaging to the prestige of the Catholic Church were the Avignon Pa-pacy (1309–1377) and the Great Schism (1378–1417). The term “Avignon Papacy” describes the relocation of the papacy from Rome to the city of Avignon in southern France (see Map 6.1) in response to political pressure from the French king Philip IV (“the Fair”; 1268–1314). Attempting to compete in prestige and po-litical influence with the secu-lar rulers of Europe, the Avignon popes established a luxurious and powerful court using stringent (and occasionally corrupt) means to accomplish their purpose. The increasing need for Church revenue led some of the Avignon popes to sell Church offices (a practice known as simony), to levy additional taxes upon the clergy, to elect mem-bers of their own families to ecclesiastical office, and to step up the sale of indulgences (pardons from temporal penalties for sins committed by lay Christians). From the twelfth century on, the Church had sold these certificates of grace—drawn from the “sur-plus” of good works left by the saints—to lay Christians who bought them in order to speed their own progress to heaven or to benefit their relatives and friends in Purgatory. While the seven popes who ruled consecutively from Avignon were able adminis-trators, their unsavory efforts at financial and political aggran-dizement damaged the reputation of the Church. The return of the papacy to Rome in 1377 was followed by one of the most devastating events in Church history, the Great Schism: A rift between French and Italian factions of the College of Cardinals led to the election of two popes, one who ruled from Avignon, the other who ruled from Rome. For more than thirty years, there were two conflicting claims to universal sovereignty and bitter controversy within the Church. As each pope excom-municated the other, laypeople questioned whether any Chris-tian soul might enter heaven. The Great Schism proved even more detrimental to Church prestige than the Avignon Papacy, for while the latter had prompted strong anticlerical feelings—even shock—in Christians who regarded Rome as the traditional home of the papacy, the Schism violated the very sanctity of the Holy Office.

## THE ARTS IN TRANSITION
Fourteenth-century Europeans manifested an unprecedented preoccupation with differences in class, gender, and personality. Both in literature and in art, there emerged a new fidelity to nature and to personal experience in the everyday world. This close, objective attention to human society and social interaction may be described as “social realism.” This new realism is apparent in the popular woodcuts of the Dance of Death (see Figure 7.2), where class differences are clearly drawn. It is also evident in the landmark vernacular works of three notable fourteenth-century writers: Giovanni Boccaccio, Christine de Pisan, and Geoffrey Chaucer. 

### Boccaccio 
The virulence of the plague and the mood of mounting despair horrified the Florentine poet and humanist Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375). A prolific writer of Italian prose romances and lyric poetry, Boccaccio was also the first biographer of Dante and the author of many Latin treatises and textbooks. But his landmark work is the celebrated collection of short stories known as the Decameron (1351). The framework for the Decameron is provided by the plague itself: Eager to escape contagion, seven young women and three young men retreat to a villa in the suburbs of Florence, where, to pass the time, each tells a story on each of ten days. The stories, designed as distractions from the horrors of the pandemic, are, in effect, amusing secular entertainments. They provide insight, however, into the social concerns and values of both their fictional narrators and Boccaccio’s reading public. Boccaccio borrowed many stories in the Decameron from popular fables, fabliaux (humorous narrative tales), and contemporary incidents. His characters resemble neither the allegorical figures of Everyman nor the courtly stereotypes of Lancelot. Rather, they are realistically conceived, high-spirited individuals who prize cleverness, good humor, and the world of the flesh over the classic medieval virtues of chivalry, piety, and humility. The Decameron must have had special appeal for men and women who saw themselves as the heroes of unstable and rapidly changing times. Toward the end of his life, Boccaccio repented writing what he himself called his “immoral tales”; nevertheless, his stories remain a lasting tribute to the varieties of human affection and desire. 

### Christine de Pisan 
The world’s first feminist writer, Christine de Pisan (1364–1428?), emerged in France. The daughter of an Italian physician, Chris-tine wed a French nobleman when she was fifteen—medieval women usually married in their mid-to late teens. Ten years later, when her husband died, Christine was left to support three chil-dren, a task she met by becoming the first female professional writer. Christine attacked the long antifemale tradition that had demeaned women and denied them the right to a university edu-cation. Her feminism is all the more significant because it oc-curred at a time in which men were making systematic efforts to restrict female inheritance of land and female membership in the guilds. In an early poem, the “Epistle to the God of Love” (1399), she protested the persistent antifemale bias of clerics and scholars with

these words:
	Some say that many women are deceitful, Wily, false, of little worth: Others that too many are liars, Fickle, flighty, and inconstant; Still others accuse them of great vices, Blaming them much, excusing them nothing, Thus do clerics, night and day, First in French verse, then in Latin, Based on who knows what books That tell more lies than drunkards do. 
	
Christine was keenly aware of the fact that Western literary tradition did not off er a representative picture of women’s impor-tance to society. Eager to correct this inequity, she became a spokesperson for female achievements and talents. Inspired by Boccaccio’s On Famous Women (1374), a collection of 106 biographies of historical and mythological women, Christine wrote the allegorical Book of the City of Ladies (1405), an attack on male misogyny and a sound defense of the female’s right to education.

### Chaucer 
Geoffrey Chaucer (1340–1400), a contemporary of Boccaccio and Christine de Pisan, was one of the greatest masters of fourteenth-century vernacular literature. Writing in the everyday language of his time (Middle English), Chaucer shaped the development of English literature much as Dante, a century earlier, had influenced the course of Italian poetry. A middle-class civil servant, a soldier in the Hundred Years War, a diplomat, and a citizen of the bustling city of London, Chaucer left an indelible image of his time in a group of stories known as the Canterbury Tales (ca. 1390). Modeled broadly on Boccaccio’s Decameron, this versified human comedy was framed by Chaucer in the setting of a pilgrimage whose partici-pants tell stories to entertain one another while traveling to the shrine of Saint Thomas à Becket in Canterbury. Chaucer’s twenty-nine pilgrims, who include a miller, a monk, a plowman, a knight, a priest, a scholar, and a prioress, provide a literary cross section of late medieval society. Although they are type characters, they are also individual personalities. (The Pardoner, for instance, is portrayed as eff eminate, while the Wife of Bath is lusty.) Chaucer characterizes each pilgrim by descriptive detail, by their lively and humorous conversations, and by the twenty

THE NEW REALISM IN LITERATURE AND ART Chaucer: 
	The Wife of Bath “There was a good Wife from near Bath, but she was somewhat deaf, which was a shame. She had such skill in clothmaking that she surpassed the weavers of Ypres and Ghent. In all her parish there was no woman who could go before her to the offertory; and if someone did, the Wife of Bath was certainly so angry that she lost all charitable feeling. Her kerchiefs were of fine texture; those she wore upon her head on Sunday weighed, I swear, ten pounds. Her fine scarlet hose were carefully tied, and her shoes were uncracked and new. Her face was bold and fair and red. All of her life she had been an estimable woman: she had had five husbands, not to mention other company in her youth—but of that we need not speak now****. And three times she had been to Jerusalem; she had crossed many a foreign river; she had been to Rome, to Bologna, to St. James’ shrine in Galicia, and to Cologne. About journeying through the country she knew a great deal. To tell the truth she was gap-toothed. She sat her gentle horse easily, and wore a fine headdress with a hat as broad as a buckler or a shield, a riding skirt about her large hips, and a pair of sharp spurs on her heels. She knew how to laugh and joke in company, and all the remedies of love, for her skill was great in that old game.” This excerpt from the Preface to the Canterbury Tales illustrates Chaucer’s use of descriptive detail to bring zesty realism to his characters. The Wife of Bath, one of the liveliest of his twenty-nine pilgrims, comes to life by way of his pen. Similarly, the artists Jean, Pol, and Herman Limbourg—who illustrated the prayer book known as the Très Riches Heures (Very Precious Hours) for Jean, duke of Berry and brother of the French king—introduced a new level of descriptive detail to the art of manuscript illumination. At the turn of the fifteenth century, the Limbourgs explored the mundane activities and labors peculiar to each month of the year. For the month of February, they produced the first snowscape in Western art. Three peasants warm themselves by a fire, while others hurry to complete their chores (Figure 7.4). The Limbourg brothers show a fascination with visual details: Dovecote and beehives are topped with new-fallen snow, smoke curls from a chimney, and three laborers lift their robes immodestly before the fire.

### [Chaucer-pg181](hum-204.md#Chaucer)
stories they tell, which range from moral tales and beast fables to fabliaux of the most risqué and bawdy sort. Like his medieval predecessors, Chaucer tended to moralize,
reserving special scorn for clerical abuse and human hypocrisy. But unlike his forebears, whose generalized view of human na-ture often produced stereotypes, Chaucer brought his characters to life by means of memorable details.
### Giotto’s New Realism 
The pioneer in painting on the eve of the Renaissance was the Florentine artist Giotto (1266–1337). Giotto’s art represents a landmark in a new era because it introduced a natural and lifelike style that anticipated Italian Renaissance picture-making. Giotto broke with the decorative formality of Byzantine painting (see Figure 4.18), which had strongly influenced the style of the late medieval altarpiece (see Figure 6.26). In place of the flat, stylized saints of the Byzantine icon, he introduced weighty, robust figures that are solemnly posed and set in shallow but convincing space. Modeling form through gradations of light and shade (a tech-nique known as chiaroscuro), he gave his figures a three-dimen-sional presence not seen since Roman times. Giotto brought this new realism to his panel paintings, and most notably to the fa-mous cycle of frescoes he executed for the family chapel of the wealthy Enrico Scrovegni in Padua (Figure 7.5). On the walls of the chapel, Giotto illustrated familiar episodes from the lives of the Virgin and Jesus. While wholly traditional in subject matter, in style Giotto took a new direction, giving weight and volume to figures whose nobility and dignity call to mind Clas-sical sculpture. In the Lamentation over Jesus (Figure 7.6), where the mourners are theatrically set in shallow but carefully defined space, Giotto subtly varied the gestures and degrees of sorrow, ranging from the stoic despair of the Virgin Mother to the grief-stricken anguish of the angels that flutter above the scene. Like the characters in Boccaccio’s Decameron and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, Giotto’s figures are convincingly human: While not individu-alized to the point of portraiture, neither are they stereotypes. They anticipate the direction of art in the age of rebirth. 

### The Ars Nova in Music 
Imagination and diversity characterized fourteenth-century mu-sic, which composers of that era self-consciously labeled the ars nova (“new art”). The music of the ars nova featured increased rhythmic complexity and aural expressiveness, achieved in part by isorhythm (literally, “same rhythm”): the close repetition of identical rhythmic patterns in different portions of a composi-tion. Isorhythm, which reflected a new interest in the manipula-tion of pitches and rhythms, gave unprecedented unity to musical compositions. At the same time, unexpected variations in rhyth



# pg.185
mic patterns might be achieved by way of a new musical effect known as syncopation, which shifted the accent from the nor-mally strong beat to the weaker beat. In France, the leading proponent of the ars nova was the French poet, priest, and composer Guillaume de Machaut (1300–1377). In his day, Machaut was more widely known and acclaimed than Chaucer or Boccaccio. Machaut held commis-sions from such members of the French aristocracy as the duke of Berry, patron of the Limbourg brothers (see Figure 7.4). Machaut wrote hundreds of poems, including a verse drama interspersed with songs. His most important musical achieve-ment, however, was his Messe de Notre Dame (Mass ofOur Lady; ca. 1350). Departing from the medieval tradition of treating the Mass as five separate compositions (based on Gregorian chant), he unified the textually fixed portions of the Mass into a single polyphonic composition, and added a sixth movement, the “Itemissa est” (“Go, the Mass is ended”) that dismissed the congre-gation. Machaut’s eff ort at coherence of design is clear evidence that composers had begun to rank musical eff ect as equal to liturgical function. This landmark treatment of the Catholic liturgy set a precedent for such composers as the sixteenth-century Palestrina and the Baroque master Johann Sebastian Bach (see pages 291–292). Machaut’s sacred compositions represent only a small part of
his total musical output. His numerous secular works include 142 polyphonic ballades (secular songs); these look back to the music of the trouvères (see page 139), but their attention to expressive detail is unique. They introduce new warmth and lyricism, as well as vivid poetic imagery—features that parallel the humanizing currents in fourteenth-century art and literature. “One who does not compose according to feelings,” wrote Mach-aut, “falsifies his work and his song.”

### THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE
The new realism in the arts, increasing secularism, and the spirit of criticism that accompanied the decline of the Church—all features of the transitional fourteenth century—came into focus in the cities of the Italian peninsula. Italy was the homeland of Roman antiquity, the splendid ruins of which stood as remind-ers of the greatness of Classical civilization. The least feudalized part of the medieval world and Europe’s foremost commercial and financial center, Italy had traded with Southwest Asian cit-ies even in the decades that followed the fall of Rome. It had also maintained cultural contacts with Byzantium, the heir to Greek culture. The cities of Italy, especially Venice and Genoa (Map 7.1), had profited financially from the Crusades and—despite the ravages of the plague—continued to enjoy a high level of commercial prosperity. But it was in Florence, dominated by its landmark cathedral, that the Renaissance would come to flower (Figure 7.7). In fourteenth-century Florence, shopkeep-ers devised a practical system (based on Arab models) of track-ing debits and credits: Double-entry bookkeeping helped merchants to maintain systematic records of transactions in what was the soundest currency in the West, the Florentine gold florin. Fifteenth-century handbooks on arithmetic, foreign cur-rency, and even good penmanship encouraged the commercial activities of traders and bankers. The pursuit of money and leisure, rather than a preoccupa-tion with feudal and chivalric obligations, marked the lifestyle of merchants and artisans who lived in the bustling city-states of Italy. Middle-class men and women challenged canonical sources of authority that frowned upon profit-making and the accumula-tion of wealth. In this materialistic and often only superficially religious society, the old medieval values no longer made sense, while those of pre-Christian antiquity seemed more compatible with the secular interests and ambitions of the rising merchant class. The ancient Greeks and Romans were ideal historical models for the enterprising citizens of the Italian city-states. In Italy, the movement to recover the culture of Classical antiquity would become the dominant feature of the Renaissance. Politically, Renaissance Italy had much in common with ancient Greece. Independent and disunited, the city-states of Italy, like those of ancient Greece, were fiercely competitive. As in Golden Age Greece, commercial rivalry among the Italian city-states led to frequent civil wars. In Italy, however, such wars were not always fought by citizens (who, as merchants, were generally ill-prepared for combat), but by condottieri (professional soldiers), whose loyalties, along with their services, were bought for a price. The papacy, a potential source of political leadership, made little effort to unify the rival Italian communes. Rather, as temporal governors of the Papal States (the lands in central Italy), Renaissance popes joined in the game of power politics, often allying themselves with one group of city-states against another. The Medici Italian Renaissance cities were ruled by members of the petty nobility, by mercenary generals, or—as in the case of Florence and Venice—by wealthy middle-class families. In Florence, a city of some 50,000 people, about one hundred families dominated political life. The most notable of these was the Medici, a wealthy banking family that rose to power during the fourteenth century and gradually took over the reins of state. Partly because the commercial ingenuity of the Medici enhanced the material sta

tus of the Florentine citizens, and partly be-cause strong, uninterrupted leadership guaranteed local economic stability, the Medici ruled Florence for four generations. The Medici merchant-princes, especially Cosimo (1389–1464) and Lorenzo “the Magnificent” (1449–1492) (Figure 7.8), supported scholarship and patronized the arts. Affluence coupled with intellectual discernment and refined taste in-spired the Medici to commission works from such artists as Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Verrocchio, and Michelangelo, who produced some of the West’s most brilliant art. For almost two centuries, scholars, poets, painters, and civic leaders shared common interests, acknowledging one another as leaders of a vigorous cultural revival.

## RENAISSANCE HUMANISM
#spa1-q1
Classical humanism, the revival of *Greco-Roman culture*, was a major feature of the Italian Renaissance and a phenomenon that gave the period its distinctly secular stamp. Classical culture did not disappear altogether with the fall of Rome in 476 C.E. It was preserved by countless Christian and Muslim scholars, revived by Charlemagne in the early Middle Ages, and championed by such medieval intellectuals as Aquinas (who took Aristotle as his mas-ter) and Dante (who chose Virgil as his guide). But the Classical revival of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries—the age of the Renaissance—generated new and more all-embracing attitudes toward Greco-Roman antiquity than any that had preceded it. Renaissance humanists advocated the recovery and uncen-sored study of the entire body of Greek and Latin manuscripts and the self-conscious imitation of Classical art and architec-ture. They regarded Classical authority not exclusively as a means of clarifying Christian truths, but as the basis for a new appraisal of the role of the individual in the world order. Thus, although Renaissance humanists still prized the Liberal Arts as the basis for intellectual advancement, they approached the Classics in a way that diff ered from that of their scholastic predecessors. Whereas the scholastics had studied the Greco-Roman legacy as the foundation for Christian dogma and faith, Renaissance humanists discovered in the Greek and Latin Classics a rational guide to the fulfillment of human potential. Additionally, the Renaissance revival of humanism diff ered from earlier revivals because it attracted the interest of a broad base of the population and not a mere handful of theologians, as was the case, for instance, in Carolingian or later medieval times. The humanists of the Renaissance were the cultural arche-ologists of their age. They uncovered new evidence of the splendor of Greco-Roman antiquity and consumed the fruits of their Western heritage. Unattached to any single school or university, this new breed of humanists pursued what the ancient Romans had called studia humanitatis, a program of study that embraced grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy. These branches of learning fostered training in moral and aesthetic values—the very subjects with which this textbook is concerned. While such an educational curriculum was assuredly not antireligious—indeed, most Renaissance humanists were devout Catholics—its focus was secular rather than religious. For these humanists, life on earth was not a valley of tears but, rather, an extended occasion during which human beings might cultivate their unique talents and abilities. Classical humanists saw no conflict, however, between humanism and religious belief. They viewed their intellectual mission as both pleasing to God and advantageous to society in general. Humanism, then, grounded in a reevaluation of Classical literature and art, represented a shift in emphasis rather than an entirely new pursuit; it involved a turning away from exclusively otherworldly preoccupations to a robust, this-worldly point of view.


# pg.188
## Petrarch: “Father of Humanism”
The most famous of the early Florentine humanists was the poet and scholar Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374). Often called the “father of humanism,” Petrarch devoted his life to the recovery, copying, and editing of Latin manuscripts. In search of these ancient sources of wisdom, he traveled all over Europe, hand-copying manuscripts he could not beg or buy from monastic li-braries, borrowing others from friends, and gradually amassing a private library of more than 200 volumes. Petrarch was a tireless popularizer of Classical studies. Reviving the epistolary (letter-writing) tradition that had practically disappeared after Roman antiquity, he wrote hundreds of letters describing his admiration for antiquity and his enthusiasm for the Classics, especially the writings of the Roman statesman Cicero (see page 74). In his letters, Petrarch eulogized and imitated Cicero’s polished prose style, which stood in refined contrast to the corrupt Latin of his own time. Petrarch’s affection for Cicero was matched only by his devotion to Augustine of Hippo and his writings (see pages 105–106). Indeed, in their introspective tone and their ex-pression of intimate feelings and desires, Petrarch’s letters reveal the profound influence of Augustine’s Confessions, a work that Petrarch deeply admired. Torn between Christian piety and his passion for Classical antiquity, Petrarch experienced recurrent psychic conflict. In his writings there is a gnawing and unresolved dissonance be-tween the dual imperatives of his heritage: the Judeo-Christian will to believe and the Classical will to reason. Such self-tor-ment—evident in Petrarch’s poems, over 300 examples of which make up the Canzoniere (Songbook; ca. 1350)—implies that Pe-trarch remained, in part, a medieval man. Yet it did not prevent him from pursuing worldly fame. In Rome in 1341, he proudly received the laurel crown for outstanding literary achievement. The tradition, which looks back to the ancient Greek practice of honoring victors in the athletic games with wreaths made from the foliage of the laurel tree, survives in our modern hon-orary title “poet laureate.” The object of Petrarch’s aff ection and the inspiration for the Canzoniere was a married Florentine woman named Laura de Sade. To Laura, Petrarch dedicated hundreds of love lyrics, many of which were written after she died of bubonic plague in 1348. While Petrarch used Latin, the language of learning, for his letters and essays, he wrote his poems and songs in vernacu-lar Italian. His favorite poetic form was the sonnet, a fourteen-line lyric poem. The sonnet form originated among the poets of Sicily, but it was Petrarch who brought it to perfection. He fa-vored a rhyme scheme (difficult to replicate in faithful English translation) of abab/abab for the octave and cde/cde for the sestet. Influenced by the “sweet style” of his Italian forebears and, more generally, by troubadour songs and Islamic lyric verse, Petrarch’s sonnets are a record of his struggle between the flesh and the spirit. In their reflective and even self-indul-gent tone, they are strikingly modern, especially where they explore Petrarch’s love for Laura—and for love itself.

Petrarch’s Sonnet No. 134 follows:
	I find no peace, yet I am not at war; I fear and hope, I burn and freeze; I rise to heaven, and fall to earth’s floor Grasping at nothing, the world I seize.
	My jailer opens not, nor locks the door, Nor binds me to herself, unbinds nor frees; Love does not kill, nor bids me to endure, Love takes my life, but will not grant me ease.
	I have no eyes yet see, no tongue yet scream; I long to perish, and seek release; I hate myself, and love another.
	I feed on grief, and in my laughter weep; Both death and life displease me; Lady, because of you, I suffer.


### Ficino: The Platonic Academy
The effort to recover, copy, and produce accurate editions of Classical writings dominated the early history of the Renaissance in Italy. By the middle of the fifteenth century, almost all the major Greek and Latin manuscripts of antiquity were available to scholars. After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, Greek manuscripts and Byzantine scholars poured into Italy, contributing to the efflorescence of what the humanist phi-losopher Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) called “a Golden Age.” Encouraged by the availability of Greek resources and supported by his patron Cosimo de’ Medici, Ficino translated the entire corpus of Plato’s writings from Greek into Latin, making them available to Western scholars for the first time since antiquity. Ficino’s translations and the founding of the Platonic Academy in Florence (financed by Cosimo) launched a reappraisal of Plato and the Neoplatonists that had major consequences in the domains of art and literature. Plato’s writings—especially the Symposium, the dialog in which love is exalted as a divine force—advanced the idea, popularized by Ficino, that “platonic” (or spiritual) love attracts the soul to God. Platonic love became a major theme among Renaissance poets and painters, who held that spiritual love was inspired by physical beauty.

### Pico della Mirandola: The Dignity of Man 
While Ficino was engaged in popularizing Plato, one of his most learned contemporaries, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), undertook the translation of numerous ancient lit-erary works in Hebrew, Arabic, Latin, and Greek. Humanist, poet, and theologian, Pico sought not only to bring to light the entire history of human thought, but also to prove that all intellectual expression shared the same divine purpose and design. This effort to discover a “unity of truth” in all philosophic thought—similar to, but more comprehensive than, the medieval quest for synthe-sis and dramatically different from our own modern pluralistic outlook—dominated the arts and ideas of the Renaissance.



# pg.189 

Both in personality and in academic ambition, Pico typified the activist spirit of Renaissance individualism—the affirmation of the unique, self-fashioning potential of the human being. In Rome, at age twenty-four, Pico boldly challenged the Church to debate some 900 propositions that disputed the institutional Church on a variety of theological and philosophical matters. The young scholar did not get the opportunity to debate his the-ses; indeed, he was persecuted for heresy and forced to flee Italy. As an introduction to the disputation, Pico had prepared the
Latin text that has come to be called the Oration on the Dignity of Man (1486). In this landmark “manifesto of humanism,” Pico drew on a wide range of literary sources to build an argument for free will and the perfectibility of the individual. Schooled in Neo-platonism (see page 105, Ideas and Issues), Pico described hu-mans as creatures able to choose their place anywhere on the hierarchical “chain of being” that linked the divine and earthly realms. While this proposition followed Ficino and the human-ists of the Platonic Academy, Pico emphasized the individual’s moral freedom to fashion one’s own nature and thus determine one’s destiny. The Renaissance view that the self-made individual occupies the center of a rational universe is nowhere better described than in the excerpt reproduced below.

### Castiglione: The Well-Rounded Person 
By far the most provocative analysis of Renaissance individualism is that found in The Book ofthe Courtier (1513–1518), a treatise by the Italian diplomat and humanist writer Baldassare Castiglione (1478–1529) (Figure 7.9). Castiglione’s Courtier was inspired by a series of conversations that had taken place among a group of sixteenth-century aristocrats at the court of Urbino, a mecca for humanist studies located in central Italy. The subject of these conversations, which Castiglione probably recorded from mem-ory, concerns the qualifications of the ideal Renaissance man and woman. Debating this subject at length, the members of the court arrive at a consensus that affords the image of l’uomo universale, the well-rounded person. Castiglione reports that the ideal man should master all the skills of the medieval warrior and display the physical proficiency of a champion athlete. But, additionally, he must possess the refinements of a humanistic education. He must know Latin and Greek (as well as his own native language), be familiar with the Classics, speak and write well, and be able to compose verse, draw, and play a musical instrument. Moreover, all that the Renaissance gentleman does, he should do with an air of nonchalance and grace, a quality summed up in the Italian word sprezzatura. This unique combination of breeding and edu-cation would prepare the individual to serve a very special end: the perfection of the state. For, as Book Four of the Courtier ex-plains, the primary duty of the well-rounded gentleman is to influence the ruler to govern wisely. Although, according to Castiglione, the goal of the ideal gentleman was to cultivate his full potential as a human being, such was not the case with the Renaissance gentlewoman. The Renaissance woman should have a knowledge of letters, music, and art—that is, like the gentleman, she should receive a humanistic education—but in no way should she violate that “soft and dainty tenderness” that is her defining quality. Castiglione’s peers agreed that “in her ways, manners, words, gestures, and bearing, a woman ought to be very unlike a man.” Just as the success of the courtier depends on his ability to influence those who rule, the success of the lady rests with her skills in entertaining the male members of the court. Castiglione’s handbook of Renaissance etiquette was based on the views of a narrow, aristocratic segment of society. But despite its selective viewpoint, it was immensely popular: It was translated into five languages and went through fifty-seven editions before the year 1600. Historically, The Book of the Courtier is an index to cultural changes that were taking place between medieval and early modern times. It departs from exclusively feudal and Christian educational ideals and formulates a pro-gram for the cultivation of both mind and body that has become fundamental to modern Western education. Representative also of the shift from medieval to modern values is Castiglione’s pre-occupation with manners rather than morals, that is, with how individuals act and how their actions may impress their peers, rather than with the intrinsic moral value of those actions.

### Female Humanists
The Renaissance provided greater opportunities for education among upper-class women than were available to their medieval counterparts. Female humanists, a small but visible group of wealthy aristocrats, usually had to choose between marriage, the convent, or the pursuit of a Liberal Arts education. Nevertheless 




**Ideas and Issues:**
	PICO: FREE WILL AND HUMAN PERFECTIBILITY “At length the Master Creator decreed that the creature to whom He [had] been unable to give anything wholly his own should share in common whatever belonged to every other being. He therefore took man, this creature of indeterminate image, set him in the middle of the world, and said to him ‘We have given you, Adam, no fixed seat or form of your own, no talent peculiar to you alone. This we have done so that whatever seat, whatever form, whatever talent you may judge desirable, these same may you have and possess according to your desire and judgement. Once defined, the nature of all beings is constrained within the laws We have prescribed for them. But you, constrained by no limits, may determine your nature of yourself, according to your own free will, in whose hands We have placed you. We have set you at the centre of the world so that from there you may more easily gaze upon whatever it contains. We have made you neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, so that you may, as the free and extraordinary shaper of yourself, fashion yourself in whatever form you prefer. It will be in your power to degenerate into the lower forms of life, which are brutish. Alternatively, you shall have the power, in accordance with the judgement of your soul, to be reborn into the higher orders, those that are divine.’” (From Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Oration on the Dignity of Man)

the study of Greek and Latin attracted a small group of women, mostly from Northern Italy. Laura Cereta (1469–1499), the daughter of a Brescian aristocrat, married at the age of fifteen and continued her studies even after the death of her husband (some eighteen months later). In her Defense of Liberal Instruction of Women (1488), she presented a compendium of notable women from biblical heroines and Classical writers to the outstanding women of her own day. While she lamented the difficulties en-countered by intelligent women, she denounced their frivolous attention to outward forms of luxury and self-adornment. Despite their excellence, she warned, intelligent women are too often inse-cure where they should be confident. The Roman noblewoman Vittoria Colonna (1490[?]–1547;Figure 7.10) wrote religious verse and popular vernacular poems of great beauty. Her ardent admirer, Michelangelo—himself a poet (see page 207)—compared her to a block of marble whose talents were hidden deep within. Veronica Franco (1546–1591), a well-educated Venetian courtesan, wrote two volumes of poetry and dozens of letters that reflected her life as a moralist, a feminist, a mother, and an intellectual. Familiar with the letters of Cicero, the poetry of Dante, and the paintings of the Venetian masters, her spirited literary exchanges with male humanists brought her notoriety. The most prolific of female humanists, the Venetian writer Lucretia Marinella (1571–1653), produced madrigals, a pastoral drama, a life of the Virgin, and an epic poem that celebrated the role of Venice in the Fourth Crusade. Her most important work, however, was the treatise The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men (1600). This formal polemic (the first of its kind written by a woman) rebuff ed the traditional mi-sogynistic litany that found women vain, jealous, lustful, fickle, idle, and inherently flawed. Following a celebratory review of illustrious women drawn from history, she presents a soundly rea-soned argument—-unique in its time—-attacking the defects of men: brutality, ingratitude, obstinacy, discourtesy, inconstancy, and van-ity. Marinella claimed to uncover the psychological roots of mi-sogyny in the anger, envy, self-love, and insufficient intelligence that, in her view, drove even the wisest and most learned of men to attack women. In the segment “A reply to the fl ippant and vain rea-soning adopted by men in their own favor,” she exclaims, “But if with a subtle intelligence they [men] should consider their own imper-fections, oh how humble and low they would become! Perhaps one day, God willing, they will perceive it.”

### The Printing Press
In 1527, the Aldine Press in Venice printed Castiglione’s Courtier in an edition of more than one thousand copies. Indeed, the humanist enterprise in general was greatly aided by a landmark in Renaissance technology: the printing press. Block printing origi-nated in China during the ninth century C.E. (see Figure 5.11) and

movable type in the eleventh. But print technology did not reach Western Europe until the fifteenth century. By 1450, Johann Gutenberg (ca. 1400–1468), a German goldsmith working in the city of Mainz, perfected a press with movable metal type that made it possible to fabricate books cheaply, rapidly, and in great numbers. The first printed book, the Gutenberg Bible (Saint Je-rome’s Latin translation), was published in 1455. By the end of the century, print shops appeared in hundreds
of European cities: seventy-seven in Italy alone. Texts that had been laboriously prepared by hand over a period of months were now reproduced in only days. Information became a commodity for mass production, as vast areas of knowledge—heretofore the exclusive domain of clerics and scholars—were readily available to the literate public. The printing press revolutionized learning and communication: The major vehicle in the spread of human-ist writings, it facilitated the rise of popular education, even as it encouraged readers to form opinions for themselves.

### Machiavelli and Power Politic
The modern notion of progress as an active process of improve-ment was born during the Renaissance. Civic humanists argued that society’s leaders must exercise virtù, that is, the self-confident vitality of the self-made individual. Virtù (not to be confused with the English word “virtue”) was the quality by which powerful personalities (usually men) mastered Fate (usually personified as
a woman). Balanced against humanist ideals of virtù and human perfectibility, however, were the realities of greed, ignorance, and cruelty. Personal ambition and commercial competition fueled frequent armed conflicts between Italy’s city-states. Gunpowder and other technological innovations made warfare increasingly impersonal, while the swollen ambitions of local and national rul-ers occasioned the worst kinds of aggression and brute force. Even the keepers of the spiritual kingdom on earth—the leaders of the Church of Rome—had become notorious for their self-indul-gence and greed, as some Renaissance popes actually took mis-tresses, led armed attacks upon neighboring states, and lived at shocking levels of luxury. The most acute critic of these realities was the Florentine diplomat and statesman Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527). A keen political observer and a student of Roman history, Machia-velli lamented Italy’s disunity in the face of continuous rivalry among the city-states. He anticipated that outside powers might try to take advantage of Italy’s internal weaknesses. The threat of foreign invasion became a reality in 1494, when French armies marched into Italy, thus initiating a series of wars that left Italy divided and impoverished. Exiled from Florence upon the collapse of the republican government he had served from 1498 to 1512, and eager to win favor with the Medici now that they had returned to power, Machiavelli wrote The Prince (1513), a politi-cal treatise that called for the unification of Italy under a powerful

	“[Count Ludovico de Canossa says:] ‘I think that what is chiefly important and necessary for the Courtier, in order to speak and write well, is knowledge; for he who is ignorant and has nothing in his mind that merits being heard, can neither say it nor write it. Next he must arrange in good order what he has to say or write;
	then express it well in words, which (if I do not err) ought to be precise, choice, rich and rightly formed, but above all, in use even among the masses; because such words as these make the grandeur and pomp of speech, if the speaker has good sense and carefulness, and knows how to choose the words most expressive of his meaning, and to exalt them, to mold position and order that they shall at a glance show and make known their dignity and splendor, like pictures placed in good and proper light....
	I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar tongue [common speech, that is, Italian] of ours; for besides the enjoyment he will find in it, he will by this means never lack agreeable entertainment with ladies, who are usually fond of such things. And if other occupations or want of study prevent his reaching such perfection as to render his writings worthy of great praise, let him be careful to suppress them so that others may not laugh at him....’”

Let her guard against wearying him by praising herself indiscreetly or by being too prolix. Let her not go about mingling serious matters with her playful or humorous discourse, or jests and jokes with her serious discourse. Let her not stupidly pretend to know that which she does not know, but modestly seek to do herself credit in that which she does know—in all things avoiding affectation, as has been said. In this way she will be adorned with good manners, and will perform with perfect grace the bodily exercises proper to women; her discourse will be rich and full of prudence, virtue and pleasantness; and thus she will be not only loved but revered by everyone, and perhaps worthy to be placed side by side with this great Courtier as well in qualities of the mind as in those of the body....

And thus, in her talk, her laughter, her play, her jesting, in short, in everything, she will be very graceful, and will entertain appropriately, and with witticisms and pleasantries befitting her, everyone who shall come before her....’” (From Baldassare Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier)

and courageous leader. This notorious little book laid out the guidelines for how an aspiring ruler might gain and maintain political power. In The Prince, Machiavelli argued that the need for a strong
state justified strong rule. He pictured the secular prince as one who was schooled in war and in the lessons of history. The ruler must trust no one, least of all mercenary soldiers. He must imi-tate the lion in his fierceness, but he must also act like a fox to outsmart his enemies. Finally, in the interest of the state, he must be ruthless, and, if necessary, he must sacrifice moral virtue. In the final analysis, the end—that is, the preservation of a strong state—will justify any means of maintaining power, however cunning or violent. Machiavelli’s grasp of past and present his-tory, which he summed up as his profound “knowledge of the actions of great men,” made him both a critic of human behavior and modern Europe’s first political scientist. Widely circulated, The Prince was hailed not simply as a
cynical examination of political expediency, but as an exposé of real-life politics—so much so that the word “Machiavellian” soon became synonymous with the idea of political duplicity. Only the master of power politics, argues the Machiavellian, can ensure the survival of the state. History’s tyrants have heeded this message.


## EARLY RENAISSANCE ART
The Renaissance produced a flowering in the visual arts rarely matched in the annals of world culture. Artists embraced the natural world with an enthusiasm that was equalled only by their ambition to master the lessons of Classical antiquity. The result was a unique and sophisticated body of art that set the standard for most of the painting, sculpture, and architecture produced in the West until the late nineteenth century. Italian Renaissance art is usually divided into two periods:
Early Renaissance (ca. 1400–1490) and High Renaissance (ca. 1490–1520). In the earlier period, a time of experimentation with new techniques of representation, productivity was cen-tered in Florence. In the later decades, when these techniques reached new levels of refinement, both patronage and productiv-ity shifted to Rome and Milan. Renaissance art was a tangible expression of increasing wealth. Artists looked not solely to traditional sources of patronage, such as the Catholic Church, but to merchants and petty despots, to middle-class patrons and 192 urban guilds, for lavish commissions that brought prestige to their businesses, families, and communities. Those who sup-ported the arts did so at least in part with an eye on leaving their mark upon society or immortalizing themselves for posterity. Thus art became evidence of material well-being as well as a visible extension of the ego in an age of individualism. Active patronage enhanced the social and financial status of Renaissance artists. Such artists were first and foremost crafts-people, apprenticed to studios in which they might achieve mas-tery over a wide variety of techniques, including the grinding of paints, the making of brushes, and the skillful copying of images. While trained to observe firmly established artistic conventions, the more innovative among them moved to create a new visual language. Indeed, for the first time in Western history, artists came to wield influence as humanists, scientists, and poets: A new phenomenon of the artist as hero and genius was born. The image of the artist as hero was promoted by the self-publicizing

eff orts of these artists, as well as by the adulation of their peers. The Italian painter, architect, and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) immortalized hundreds of Renaissance artists in his monumental biography The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Architects, and Sculptors (1550). Vasari drew to legendary propor-tions the achievements of notable Renaissance figures, many of whom he knew personally.

### Early Renaissance Architecture 
Early Renaissance architects were devoted to the principles laid out by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (see page 78). Among these principles was the Classical notion that human proportions mirrored the universal order. The human microcosm (the “lesser world”) was the natural extension of the divine mac-rocosm (the “greater world”). Accordingly, the study of nature and an understanding of its harmonious design put one in touch with the universe. Rational architecture, reflecting natural laws, according to Renaissance theorists, would cultivate rational indi-viduals; and harmoniously proportioned buildings would produce ideal citizens.

### Brunelleschi 
The revival of Classical architecture was inau-gurated by the architect, sculptor, and theorist Filippo Brunelles-chi (1377–1446). In 1420, Brunelleschi won a civic competition for the design of the dome of Florence Cathedral (see Figures 7.7 and 7.11). His dome—the largest since that of the Pantheon in Rome (see Figure 3.8)—consists of two octagonal shells. Each incorporates eight curved panels joined by massive ribs that soar upward from the octagonal drum—the section immediately be-neath the dome—to converge at an elegant lantern through which light enters the interior. In the space between the two shells, Brunelleschi designed an interlocking system of ribs that operate like hidden flying buttresses (Figure 7.11). At the base of the dome, reinforced by stone chains, he constructed a double wall made of sandstone bricks laid in herringbone fashion. To raise the dome he devised new methods of hoisting stone, and inge-nious masonry techniques, all of which won him acclaim in Flor-ence. Indeed, Brunelleschi’s younger colleague Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1474) hailed the completed dome as “a feat of engineering ... unknown and unimaginable among the ancients.” Brunelleschi’s dome became a legend in its time; it remains an architectural landmark, the largest masonry dome in the world, and the defining feature of the Florentine skyline. Brunelleschi was among the first architects of the Renais-sance to defend Classical principles of symmetry and propor-tion in architectural design. In the graceful little chapel he produced for the Pazzi family of Florence in the cloister of the Franciscan basilica of Santa Croce (Figure 7.12), he placed a dome over the central square of the inner hall and buttressed the square with two short barrel vaults. Since the exterior of this self-contained structure was later modified by the addition of a portico, it is in the interior that Brunelleschi’s break with the medieval past is fully realized (Figure 7.13). Gray stone mold-ings and gray Corinthian pilasters—shallow, flattened, rectangular columns that adhere to the wall surface—emphasize the “seams” between the individual segments of the stark white interior, producing a sense of order and harmony that is unsurpassed in Early Renaissance architecture. Whereas the medieval cathedral coaxes one’s gaze heavenward, the Pazzi Chapel fixes the beholder decisively on earth.


### Alberti 
Brunelleschi’s enthusiasm for an architecture of harmonious proportions was shared by the multitalented Floren-tine humanist Alberti. Alberti’s scientific treatises on painting, sculpture, and architecture reveal his admiration for Roman architecture and his familiarity with the writings of Vitruvius. In his Ten Books on Architecture (1452; modeled on Vitruvius’ work of the same title), Alberti argued that architectural design should proceed from the square and the circle, the two most perfect geometric shapes. This proposition was the guiding precept for all Alberti’s buildings (a total of only six); it would become the definitive principle of High Renaissance composition. In the townhouse Alberti designed for the wealthy Rucellai family of Florence (Figure 7.14)—a structure for which there
