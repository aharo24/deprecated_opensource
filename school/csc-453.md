1. one to one
2. one to many
3. many to many

1--> required atleast one or more
O--> optional

product to order is optional-many because if the product is at the store you can just buy it directly instead of ordering it

0 --> means that you give Null priority
l  --> means you prioritize atleast one 


Strong Entity
	It means it relies on itself like a Base Class
- exists independently of other types of entities
- has its own unique identifier
	- identifier _underlined with single line_

Weak Entity
	we have it because of another entity? (confused)
	its like a **derived** class that depends on the base class

-  dependent on a strong entity (identifying owner); cannot exist on its own
-  does not have a unique identifier (only a partial identifier)
-  entity box and partial identifier have double lines

Associative Entity
	IDK?




### Entities
in `java`  they are known as objects

- Entity 
	- aperson, a place, an object, an event, or a concept in the user environment about which the organization wishes to maintain data
- 
- 
- Entity type
	- a collection of entities that share common properties or characteristics
- 
- 
- Entity instance
	- a single occurrence of an entity type



### Attributes 

![](z/aharo24%202023-01-30%20at%2012.08.17%20PM.png)

| Attributes | Attribute Data type | Example instance |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Name       | Char                | Gio              |
| Zip Code   | Char                | 90660            | 




### Classifications of attributes:
Required versus Optional
	like addy or ssn 

Simple versus Composite
	like full address 
	vs
	break down model 
		ie... it ask for city, state, house addy etc..

Composite --> has (  paranthesis  )

Single-Valued versus Multivalued
| id  | name | Skills   |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| 100 | Yare | C++      |
| 101 | Mike | Swimming |



Stored versus Derived

Identifier


multivalued

###
signs
() --> composite
[] -->  derived from base 
{} -->  multivalue




if you think "it could be" immediatly remove it
