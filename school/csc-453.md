1. one to one
2. one to many
3. many to many

1--> required atleast one or more
O--> optional 

to link [db] we use the unique identifier `attribute`

product to order is optional-many because if the product is at the store you can just buy it directly instead of ordering it

0 --> means that you give Null priority
l  --> means you prioritize atleast one 


Strong Entity
	It means it relies on itself like a Base Class
- exists independently of other types of entities
- has its own unique identifier
	- identifier _underlined with single line_

Weak Entity
	we have it because of another entity? (confused)
	its like a **derived** class that depends on the base class

-  dependent on a strong entity (identifying owner); cannot exist on its own
-  does not have a unique identifier (only a partial identifier)
-  entity box and partial identifier have double lines

Associative Entity
	IDK?




### Entities
in `java`  they are known as objects

- Entity 
	- aperson, a place, an object, an event, or a concept in the user environment about which the organization wishes to maintain data
- 
- 
- Entity type
	- a collection of entities that share common properties or characteristics
- 
- 
- Entity instance
	- a single occurrence of an entity type



### Attributes 

![](z/aharo24%202023-01-30%20at%2012.08.17%20PM.png)

| Attributes | Attribute Data type | Example instance |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Name       | Char                | Gio              |
| Zip Code   | Char                | 90660            | 




### Classifications of attributes:
Required versus Optional
	like addy or ssn 

Simple versus Composite
	like full address 
	vs
	break down model 
		ie... it ask for city, state, house addy etc..

Composite --> has (  paranthesis  )

Single-Valued versus Multivalued
| id  | name | Skills   |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| 100 | Yare | C++      |
| 101 | Mike | Swimming |



Stored versus Derived

Identifier


multivalued

### signs for sql
signs
()   -->  composite identifyer
[]    -->  derived from base 
{}   -->  multivalue
"  " -->  simple




if you think "it could be" immediatly remove it 


# Feb 1, 2023 

#### identifier (key)


•Identifier:
	an attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies individual instances of an entity type


ie... 
ssn, email, phone, 

**NO NO**:
	–Will not change in value
	–Will not be null
	•Avoid intelligent identifiers:
	(e.g., containing locations or people that might change)
	.
	.
	also no more than 2 for a unique identifier its bad practice 





| flight number | Date     | number of passaengers | aircraft type | Airplane ID |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| AB10          | 1,1,2023 | 250                   | MAX 500       | 100         |
| AB10          | 1,2,2023 | 250                   | MAX 500       | 101         |
| AZ10          | 1,1,2023 | 230                   | MAX 300       | 102         |
| AZ10          | 1,2,2023 | 230                   | MAX 300       | 103         | 

^
- flight number is not unique
- data is not unique 
- num. of passenger is not unique 
- aircraft type is not unique
	- 
	- 
	- flight number + data is **Unique**




•Simple versus Composite Identifier

•Candidate Identifier – an attribute that could be an identifier; it satisfies the requirements for being an identifier



•Qualifiers are ?


below:
	called relationship attribute 

you can only have an associate entity when its:
	**many to many only**
