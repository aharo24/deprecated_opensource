Just as polynomials grow more slowly than exponentials, logarithms grow more slowly than polynomials.

### Matching med-school students to hospitals


Unstable pair. Hospital h and student s form an unstable pair if both:
- h prefers s to one of its admitted students.
- s prefers h to assigned hospital.

Stable assignment. Assignment with no unstable pairs.
- Natural and desirable condition.
- Individual self-interest prevents any hospital–student side deal.



### Perfect matching
Def. A matching M is a set of ordered pairs h–s with h ∈ H and s ∈ S s.t.
- Each hospital h ∈ H appears in at most one pair of M.
- Each student s ∈ S appears in at most one pair of M.
Def. A matching M is perfect if | M | = | H | = | S | = n.
