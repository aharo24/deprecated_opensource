Summar:
... Actively learning for [UCSD](https://cse.ucsd.edu/research) research and [Google](https://research.google/research-areas/natural-language-processing/) research. Please refer to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aharo24/) for more details.

...I have gained extensive knowledge in machine learning through my personal studies, with a focus on topics such as linear regression, data visualization, and the use of popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn and Matplotlib. I also completed a capstone project that demonstrated my ability to apply these concepts in a practical setting. My goal is to continue to deepen my understanding in this field and apply it to real-world problems.


# active contribution
### [alacritty](https://github.com/aharo24/dot-alacritty) 
...Alacritty configuration, optimized for speed and efficiency. I've spent countless hours tweaking and fine-tuning.

### [starship](https://github.com/aharo24/dot-starship)
...Hours of research on color theory and what hues stimulate the eyes, and hand-picked hacked icons.

### [vivaldi](https://github.com/aharo24/dot-vivaldi)
...I've included a list of custom hotkeys, including shortcuts for the panel, window, dev, and tabs. Detail color combinations to stimulate long hours of docs/coding/dev.

### [universal markdown linker](https://github.com/aharo24/universal-markdown-linker)
- #### This tool was developed and is maintained by [Angel Haro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aharo24/), the founder of Universal Markdown Linker.
...Developed an open-source Python script that makes it easy to keep markdown files organized and error-free. The script eliminates the need for manual searching and guarantees that all links will work, even if the file structure of your repository changes.
