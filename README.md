<h3 align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/aharo24/dot-vivaldi"> vivaldi ✅ </a> </h3>

- My Vivaldi configuration includes a comprehensive list of custom hotkeys, designed to make your browsing experience more efficient and intuitive. I have included shortcuts for a wide range of actions, including panel navigation, window management, dev tools, and tabs. I have also taken the time to carefully choose color combinations that will not strain your eyes during long coding or document editing sessions.

<h3 align="center"> actively learning </h3>

- Actively learning for [Kean University](https://www.kean.edu) research and [Google](https://research.google/research-areas/natural-language-processing/) research. 

- I have gained extensive knowledge in machine learning through my personal studies, with a focus on topics such as linear regression, data visualization, and the use of popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn and Matplotlib. I also completed a capstone project that demonstrated my ability to apply these concepts in a practical setting. My goal is to continue to deepen my understanding in this field and apply it to real-world problems.
