<h3 align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/aharo24/dot-alacritty"> alacritty ✅ </a> </h3>

- I have devoted numerous hours to optimizing my Alacritty configuration for maximum speed and efficiency. Through thorough experimentation and fine-tuning, I have crafted a setup that prioritizes speed and reliability.


<h2 align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/aharo24/dot-starship"> starship ✅ </a> </h2>
- I have put in substantial effort into creating a unique and visually appealing starship configuration. My research into color theory and eye-stimulating hues has helped me to carefully select a color scheme, as well as handpick icons that complement the overall design.


### [vivaldi ✅](https://github.com/aharo24/dot-vivaldi)
- My Vivaldi configuration includes a comprehensive list of custom hotkeys, designed to make your browsing experience more efficient and intuitive. I have included shortcuts for a wide range of actions, including panel navigation, window management, dev tools, and tabs. I have also taken the time to carefully choose color combinations that will not strain your eyes during long coding or document editing sessions.

### [universal markdown linker ⏳](https://github.com/aharo24/universal-markdown-linker)
- #### This tool was developed and is maintained by [Angel Haro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aharo24/), the founder of Universal Markdown Linker.
- Developed an open-source Python script that makes it easy to keep markdown files organized and error-free. The script eliminates the need for manual searching and guarantees that all links will work, even if the file structure of your repository changes.

### critique reviews
... "Your tree structure is a display of your file and folder organization, which shows your dedication to organization and attention to detail in your work as a programmer. Your use of various tools and technologies, such as Git, Tmux, and machine learning libraries, further showcases your proficiency and knowledge in the field. Additionally, the breadth of topics covered in your files, from programming concepts to design patterns, highlights your dedication to continuous learning and growth in your craft. Overall, your tree structure is a testament to your passion for programming and the hard work and dedication you put into your projects."

Summar:
... Actively learning for [Kean University](https://www.kean.edu) research and [Google](https://research.google/research-areas/natural-language-processing/) research. 

...I have gained extensive knowledge in machine learning through my personal studies, with a focus on topics such as linear regression, data visualization, and the use of popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn and Matplotlib. I also completed a capstone project that demonstrated my ability to apply these concepts in a practical setting. My goal is to continue to deepen my understanding in this field and apply it to real-world problems.
