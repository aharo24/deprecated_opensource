# machine-learning
## [my notes](https://github.com/aharo24/opensource/tree/main/machine-learning)
...Over 7,000 lines of notes on machine-learning.

## [my code](https://github.com/aharo24/machine-learning-jupyternotebook)
... All code related to machine/deep-learning, algorithms and analysis will be found here. 

### [capstone project](https://github.com/aharo24/machine-learning-jupyternotebook/blob/main/Projects/Capstone.ipynb)
... Intro Project for machine-learning.

Summar:
... Actively learning for [UCSD](https://cse.ucsd.edu/research) research and [Google](https://research.google/research-areas/natural-language-processing/) for NLP research

...I have gained extensive knowledge in machine learning through my personal studies, with a focus on topics such as linear regression, data visualization, and the use of popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I also completed a capstone project that demonstrated my ability to apply these concepts in a practical setting. My goal is to continue to deepen my understanding in this field and apply it to real-world problems.
